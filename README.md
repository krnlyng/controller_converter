controller_converter
====================

# Controller Converter
this project uses a parallax propeller to convert between controller signals for various consoles/controllers

# features so far
    * zero frame input delay due to clever synchronization

# modules
    i will add more modules as this project progresses, currently there is one module available which allows using 4 gamecube controllers on an n64 console
